"""
This project is designed to parse an Excel file containing Snowflake schema 
and convert it into a Talend-compatible XML schema.

The main functionality includes:
- Reading and interpreting the Snowflake schema from the provided Excel file.
- Mapping the schema structure and metadata to a format compatible with Talend.
- Generating an XML schema file that can be directly used in Talend for further processing.

Note:
- Ensure the input Excel file adheres to the expected format for accurate parsing.
- Validate the generated XML schema in Talend to confirm compatibility.
